## What is it?

This repository is aimed towards documenting by journey to understand Hypervisors, and try to write one of my own in Rust. Apart from this repository, I might end up writing up a blog post or two about it, on my [blog](https://s4dr0t1.github.io).

This is strictly a WIP and is not supposed to be tested in production environments.

## Why?

A lot of people have done what I'm trying to do here, already, and they're probably much better at it. This is just my learning attempt.
