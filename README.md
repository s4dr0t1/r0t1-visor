## What is it?

This repository is aimed towards documenting by journey in understanding Hypervisors, especially [Hardware-assisted virtualization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware-assisted_virtualization), and trying to write one of my own in Rust, targeting Intel VT-x hardware functionality. Apart from this repository, I might end up writing up a blog post or two about it, on my [blog](https://s4dr0t1.github.io).

This is strictly a WIP, expect heavy code refactoring and major changes. It is not supposed to be tested in production environments.

## Why?

A lot of people have done what I'm trying to do here, already, and they're probably much better at it. This is my own attempt to do the same and learn something from it.
